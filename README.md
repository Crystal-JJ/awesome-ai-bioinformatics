This project aims to summarize the awesome research progress of AI+bioinformatics (e.g. molecules, proteins, transcriptional profiles, genes) from the perspective of computer science majors. Computer scientists tend to focus on data, tasks, and algorithms. Therefore, we use the logic of `data->task->algorithm` to summarize.
