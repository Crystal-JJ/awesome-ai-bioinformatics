This project aims to summarize the awesome research progress of AI+bioinformatics (e.g. molecules, proteins, mass spectrum, genes) from the perspective of computer science majors. Computer scientists tend to focus on data, tasks, and algorithms. Therefore, we use the logic of `data->task->algorithm` to summarize. 



This repository is an ongoing project, and we welcome more collaborators to join us! If you want to become a partner, please [contact us](mailto:xianghx21@gmail.com). If you want to contribute something, please feel free to contribute.
